        <h4>HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, allows web users to create and structure sections, paragraphs, and links
            using elements, tags, and attributes. However, it’s worth noting that HTML is not considered a programming
            language as it can’t create dynamic functionality. <br>

            HTML has a lot of use cases, namely: <br>

            Web development: Developers use HTML code to design how a browser displays web page elements, such as text,
            hyperlinks, and media files. <br>
            Internet navigation: Users can easily navigate and insert links between related pages and websites as HTML
            is heavily used to embed hyperlinks. <br>
            Web documentation: HTML makes it possible to organize and format documents, similarly to Microsoft Word.
            It’s also worth noting that HTML is now considered an official web standard. The World Wide Web Consortium
            (W3C) maintains and develops HTML specifications, along with providing regular updates. </h4>
